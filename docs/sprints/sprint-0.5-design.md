# Sprint 0.5: Design Sprint

## Duration
2024-12-16 — 2024-12-23 (1 week)

## Objective
Create interactive mockups for stakeholder QA and acceptance before infrastructure investment.

## Goals
- [ ] Establish visual identity (dark mode default, colour themes)
- [ ] Create all core view mockups
- [ ] Validate drag-and-drop UX patterns
- [ ] Confirm mobile responsiveness approach
- [ ] Obtain stakeholder sign-off

## Deliverables

| ID | Deliverable | Status | Notes |
|----|-------------|--------|-------|
| AF-001 | Theme system with dark mode | Not Started | CSS custom properties, toggle |
| AF-002 | Colour theme selector | Not Started | 5-6 accent themes |
| AF-003 | Dashboard mockup | Not Started | All widgets |
| AF-004 | Kanban board mockup | Not Started | Critical: drag-drop UX |
| AF-005 | Card detail modal | Not Started | All features shown |
| AF-006 | Questionnaire form | Not Started | Public-facing |
| AF-007 | Mobile responsive views | Not Started | All views |

## Approach

1. **Read Skills First**
   - `/mnt/skills/public/frontend-design/SKILL.md`
   - `/mnt/skills/examples/theme-factory/SKILL.md`

2. **Build in Claude Artifacts**
   - Interactive React components
   - Real state management
   - Working theme toggle

3. **Export Specifications**
   - Document design tokens
   - Component patterns
   - Animation specs

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All mockups render correctly in dark mode by default
- [ ] Theme toggle works (dark/light/system)
- [ ] Colour theme selector changes accent colours
- [ ] Drag-and-drop has clear visual feedback
- [ ] Mobile layouts demonstrated
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off obtained

## Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Design iteration delays | Keep mockups focused, iterate fast |
| Scope creep | Stick to visual validation only |
| Stakeholder availability | Async review via screenshots/recordings |

## Definition of Done

Sprint is complete when:
1. All 7 deliverables have working mockups
2. Stakeholder has reviewed and approved
3. Design tokens documented for Phase 1 implementation
4. CURRENT_STATE.md updated with decisions made
